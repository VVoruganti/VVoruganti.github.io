      <title>Method for determining a start offset between a video recording device and an inertial measurement unit for use in synchronizing motion data of an object collected by the inertial measurement unit attached to the object with video frames captured by an image sensor of the video recording device of the object in motion </title>

      <description>This patent was developed in order to address the problem of trying to synchronize two simultaneous data streams that relied on different clocks. The contraints under which this methodology were developed involved the process to be completeley offline to not involve establishing a new connection between the data collection devices.
The final solution had several aspects to it:
 A testing system to determine the level to which the two devices are out of sync A calculation methodology for using the information from the test to quantify the difference A consideration for variable rates and drift in both of the devices.</description>
