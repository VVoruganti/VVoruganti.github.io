Half of the time it was
like real life, but the other half it was as if I was in a cartoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dream&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premise of the dream was that I was attending a fancy prep school and part of
a strange club where every member was actually a demon. But we were only demons in
name. It was more like we were magical creatures from a Final Fantasy game. In
reality, we were quite wholesome and acted like a home where loners could come and
find a purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The School&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, as our club was operating the principal was trying to verify
if demons really did exist in his school. He kept trying to enlist my help in his
search, so I had to constantly throw him off. As the days went by we started helping
lots of different people with their problems by turning them into demons and giving
a new home and purpose. I don&apos;t remember the details of many of these, but we&apos;ll
get to that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Karaoke&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, the style switches from a cartoon to real life again. I end up
going to a karaoke bar with my high school friends. The waitress at the bar
thinks we are too young and seats us in the kids&apos; sections. Now none of us
actually wanted to be at this bar, but we reluctantly stay and even end up
singing some songs together. Across from us is another group of friends who
seem to be like our rivals. They try to put on a performance to outshine us,
but no one in our group seemed to really care. Eventually, two other kids who
were described as &quot;being from the wrong side of the tracks&quot; sit with us and
start hitting on the waitress. At some point, one of them throws me what looks
like a cosmic brownie, but is actually a pot brownie. I started questioning why
so much effort was put into making it look like an actual cosmic brownie. Later
in the night, the police show up to the karaoke bar and start going through the
locker room (I don&apos;t know why a bar has a locker room) looking for drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rescue Time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we switch back to the cartoon style and go to a flashback of helping someone
in the demon club. This person happened to be one of my very good friends in real
life. After helping her she becomes the designated summoner for the club. Then
I flashback further to the events of actually helping her. I had gone to her
town with two ghost hunters who talked to the ghosts in the neighborhood to find
her whereabouts. We eventually found her in what seemed to be a Wegmans parking lot.
She was having issues at home so we took her away to something akin to the underground
railroad. Except in this dream world, the underground railroad was made up of Chipotles.
Every Chipotle was really a front to hide refugees who needed a safe haven. So
we dropped her off where she was rated as their best guest to date. She ended
up getting a +10 rating on the Chipotle guest list app which apparently existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&apos;s where I woke up...&lt;/p&gt;

so I&apos;m just going to focus on the interesting ones. I didn&apos;t expect to have another
one so fast but here we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dream&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Pool&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the dream started out with me at a pool in a strange community center.
I don&apos;t remember what exactly I was doing at the pool besides swimming around.
It felt like I was here hours and hours, but eventually, I had to get out of the
pool so that it could be cleaned. Soon after I was forced to leave because I
was not with any group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Explosion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After leaving the pool I decided to go back the high school, which is about a
25-minute drive from my childhood home. However, in the dream, I ended up
walking to the school, and I came from the completely opposite direction.
From what I could tell, I was traveling back in time in order to stop some sort
of tragedy from occurring. I stopped at a particularly busy intersection where
the traffic is always really bad due to the roads being too small. One of the
buildings I was standing next to ended up exploding, which really alarmed me.
I decided to call the police, but the building was the police station. A police
officer came up to me in a car and said that he &quot;would investigate&quot; then suddenly
turned around and drove away on the wrong side of the road. This entire time the
traffic jam on the intersection continued like normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Crime&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The building that exploded then revealed that it had a secondary purpose of being
a daycare for small children. My dream transitioned to the point of view of a child
in the daycare. I was in a different house and dealing with the trauma of the explosion.
I was freaking out, but then, as quickly as I became this child, I quickly became
myself again. I was at school finally, except the school looked like my childhood
home. My class was also my room. One of the other students around me had stolen
something and chaos started to ensue in order to find the culprit. Then on our
phones President Barack Obama sent a message telling the students to be calm. It
was then tasked to me to find the thief. I discovered him in what looked like my
parents&apos; bedroom and retrieved whatever was stolen. I&apos;m not entirely sure what the
item was. It might have been a wallet, but I can&apos;t be too certain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Class&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the chaos was down, I started conducting a science experiment with one of my
professors from Georgia Tech. We were constructing a telescope while he was complaining
about why the International Baccalaureate system is flawed. This was very strange
both because I would not expect him to know about the IB and he was an ECE professor.
We finished the telescope but when we tried to open the window to use it, a large
gust of wind blew everything away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a gap in my memory here, but the last event I remember is sitting around
a table (which may have also been my bed) with one guy and girl. I had recognized
the guy from high school, but I had never seen this girl before. The girl started
talking about how she was incredibly high from taking 20 doses of LSD, while the
other guy and I started to get concerned. The vice-principal of my high school
showed up and started to do a blood test of the girl without her noticing. The
principal then said not to get involved with the girl before I finally woke up.&lt;/p&gt;

a good friend of mine who suggested the idea that I start a
dream journal. I thought this would be a fun so here I go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rules of my Dreams&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I get into my dream I want to explain some standard principles that
my dreams tend to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I am fairly in control of the plotline and scenario of a dream,
but I never realize this fact. My dream will quickly change depending on my
thoughts to the point where the entire scenario is different. It&apos;s a similar
feeling to when you have a large thought loop where one moment you are thinking
about what you want to eat for dinner and 30 minutes later you are thinking about
the proper way to write a ternary statement in Lua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, I will rationalize the most absurd ideas possible for the sake of not
realizing that I am in a dream. An example of this could be that another
character besides me will be present in the dream, but will never say something.
Usually, this probably just because I don&apos;t actually know what they would have
said in whatever wacky scenario we&apos;re in. Nevertheless, I&apos;ll come up with a
crazy explanation like &quot;oh they were cursed by the evil queen in the castle&quot; even
if there has never been any mention of a queen before now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I got that out of the way, I wanted to describe my most recent vivid dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dream&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Party&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my dream started with me at a house party. It was not a house that I recognized
, but I did recognize many of the people at this house. The attendees were all
family friends which consisted of both my parents&apos; and my brother&apos;s friends
Both of these groups of people seemed to be endlessly embroiled in mindless
chit chat, however, I cannot remember what they talked about. Besides these two groups,
there was also me, my childhood friend, and a ton of small children 12 and younger.
My friend and I were tasked with taking care of the kids and keeping them occupied. So we spent
our time trying to come up with creative ways to keep the kids entertained. We gave
them coloring books, played hide and seek, and at some point, I taught some of them
how to play League of Legends. At this point, I thought everything was going well,
but suddenly 3 of the kids came up to me and said they want to repent and then starting
speaking in Spanish. Now, this was really weird because I do not know Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;High School Factory Life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, I was transported back to high school (a true nightmare), except it wasn&apos;t
really highschool. Rather I was in something that resembled more of a steampunk
factory or a battleship. All of the students were engineers in this thing and were
all performing different functions. I don&apos;t remember too much from this part except
being in something like a dark basement looking for something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Free Time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then eventually we were on the Georgia Tech campus, but the people around me were
still my peers from high school. During this part, everyone was relaxing. Different
people split up into to their cliques and started chatting or doing some strange
activities like sailing in the grass. I wasn&apos;t sure what to do in this situation
and ended up walking off into the sunset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hotel Room Shenanigans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I was transported to an FBLA conference (A business club from high school)
where I was hanging out in a hotel room. However, this quickly transitioned into
me managing the conference and working with hotel staff to change the logistical
details of the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Wedding Planner&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference seemed to make a slow and gradual transition to a wedding. At first,
one half of the venue was a conference and the other half was a wedding.
Pretty soon it was only a wedding; one that I was managing with my cousin.
Let&apos;s refer to her as cousin 1. Turns out the wedding was for another cousin who
we can call cousin 2. For some reason, she was 20 years old and getting an arranged
marriage. As far as the eye could see there were giant pastries and cakes lined
up on circular tables in a giant ballroom. Cousin 2&apos;s father (my uncle) started
giving a loud speech about how proud he was of his daughter. While moving through
the different rooms of the venue I encountered cousin 2&apos;s sister (cousin 3) who was
just hanging out with her friends and taking the whole affair nonchalantly. I spent
some time talking to her before finally waking up to my alarm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can imagine I was quite confused and dazed by the events of the night.&lt;/p&gt;

Initially, when I was setting up Linux as a dual boot I found that I was not a
fan of the drastic cut to performance and battery life I would have to commit to.
So, I took it upon myself to try and optimize my development environment on Windows,
despite it being less than ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I did was set up Windows Subsystem Linux (WSL). This is basically
a utility that was built by Microsoft that lets you run a terminal with a full Linux
kernel while still in Windows. It sort of operates like a virtual machine, but
you can access both your Linux and regular Windows file system from within it.
There are two versions of this and which one you want to use will vary depending
on your needs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WSL 1 is the original version which has the benefit of being faster when you are
messing with your Windows filesystem, while WSL 2 is the newer one and has better
performance in the linux file system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I figured I would probably be staying within the Linux file system so I opted to
use WSL 2. Now, at the time of writing this, WSL 2 was only available if you used
the Windows Insider Build of Windows 10. I also chose to use the Ubuntu version
of WSL, but you can choose whichever one you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Terminal Emulator&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I wanted to do was find a good terminal emulator that I could
use that was fast and customizable. Initially, I was between
&lt;a href=&quot;https://conemu.github.io/&quot;&gt;ConEMU&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty&quot;&gt;Alacritty&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ConEMU seems to be the more feature-rich application but I found the support for
color customization to be quite lackluster as the color schemes I tried were not
working. Also, I found performance with apps like &lt;code class=&quot;abyss grvsc-mm-tJ07fR&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot; data-index=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-t9ljLd-1 grvsc-tJ07fR-1&quot;&gt;vim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; were quite slow. &lt;strong&gt;Alacritty&lt;/strong&gt;
is great because it was built with performance in mind and messing with colors
was really straight forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I installed it using chocolatey&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;grvsc-container abyss grvsc-mm-tJ07fR&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot; data-index=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;grvsc-code&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-source&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-t9ljLd-1 grvsc-tJ07fR-1&quot;&gt;choco install alacritty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then edited my &lt;em&gt;alacritty.yml&lt;/em&gt; file to make it open WSL by default and to mess
with the color scheme. For me this file was located in
C:Users{my user}\AppData\Roaming\alacritty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;grvsc-container abyss grvsc-mm-tJ07fR&quot; data-language=&quot;yaml&quot; data-index=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;grvsc-code&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-source&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-t9ljLd-7 grvsc-tJ07fR-3&quot;&gt;shell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-t9ljLd-1 grvsc-tJ07fR-1&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-source&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-t9ljLd-1 grvsc-tJ07fR-1&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-t9ljLd-7 grvsc-tJ07fR-3&quot;&gt;program&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-t9ljLd-1 grvsc-tJ07fR-1&quot;&gt;: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-t9ljLd-11 grvsc-tJ07fR-8&quot;&gt;wsl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another one I messed around with was the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701&quot;&gt;Windows terminal&lt;/a&gt;
which was still in beta and experimental at the time. It had pretty could
performance, but I found it was still fairly buggy when using TUI application
or with managing nice color schemes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tmux&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next thing I wanted to do was to configure Tmux to make sure that colors
stayed the same (I&apos;m a bit of a stickler for color schemes if you haven&apos;t noticed).
I use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/voronianski/oceanic-next-color-scheme&quot;&gt;OceanicNext&lt;/a&gt;
Color scheme, but it wasn&apos;t really showing up properly in tmux. So I had to edit my
&lt;code class=&quot;abyss grvsc-mm-tJ07fR&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot; data-index=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-t9ljLd-1 grvsc-tJ07fR-1&quot;&gt;.tmux.conf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;grvsc-container abyss grvsc-mm-tJ07fR&quot; data-language=&quot;tmux&quot; data-index=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;grvsc-code&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-source&quot;&gt;set-option -sg escape-time 10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-source&quot;&gt;set-option -g default-terminal &amp;quot;tmux-256color&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-source&quot;&gt;set-option -sa terminal-overrides &amp;quot;,*256col*:RGB&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-source&quot;&gt;set-option -ga terminal-overrides &amp;quot;,*256col*:Tc&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that my tmux looked just as beautiful as before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Xserver&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I wanted to set up an Xserver so that I could run gui applications from
within WSL. This isn&apos;t really perfect but I could. I downloaded an application
called &lt;a href=&quot;https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/&quot;&gt;VcXsrv&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to set it up to work with WSL I set the following
variable in my &lt;code class=&quot;abyss grvsc-mm-tJ07fR&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot; data-index=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-t9ljLd-1 grvsc-tJ07fR-1&quot;&gt;.bashrc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Just make sure to substitute in your own IP address.
you can find it in the command prompt with &lt;code class=&quot;abyss grvsc-mm-tJ07fR&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot; data-index=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-t9ljLd-1 grvsc-tJ07fR-1&quot;&gt;ipconfig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE&lt;/strong&gt; the ip address given if you run &lt;code class=&quot;abyss grvsc-mm-tJ07fR&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot; data-index=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-t9ljLd-1 grvsc-tJ07fR-1&quot;&gt;ifconfig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; in WSL is different than your
actual IP address, so make sure you use command &lt;em&gt;prompt&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;grvsc-container abyss grvsc-mm-tJ07fR&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot; data-index=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;grvsc-code&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-source&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-t9ljLd-7 grvsc-tJ07fR-11&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-t9ljLd-1 grvsc-tJ07fR-1&quot;&gt; DISPLAY:{MY IP ADDRESS}:0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-source&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-t9ljLd-7 grvsc-tJ07fR-11&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-t9ljLd-1 grvsc-tJ07fR-1&quot;&gt; LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;once you reload bash you can startup up VcXsrv and follow the prompt on the first
2 windows. On the third window make sure you check Disable Access Control&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if you want to try XFCE like above install&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;grvsc-container abyss grvsc-mm-tJ07fR&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot; data-index=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;grvsc-code&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-source&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-t9ljLd-1 grvsc-tJ07fR-1&quot;&gt;sudo apt-get xfce-session&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then once the server is running just run &lt;code class=&quot;abyss grvsc-mm-tJ07fR&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot; data-index=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-t9ljLd-1 grvsc-tJ07fR-1&quot;&gt;xfce-session&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; in the terminal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE&lt;/strong&gt; This is a notable difference between WSL 1 and 2. I don&apos;t think you
follow the same steps with WSL 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I had that setup, I was able to run things like XFCE from within windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Running Windows Applications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A neat trick of WSL is that if everything is running properly you can actually
run windows .exe programs from within WSL. You can try this out by typing
&lt;code class=&quot;abyss grvsc-mm-tJ07fR&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot; data-index=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-t9ljLd-1 grvsc-tJ07fR-1&quot;&gt;explorer.exe &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-t9ljLd-15 grvsc-tJ07fR-11&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; This is a handy trick to open a file explorer in your WSL partition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also handy if you want to run a windows program on files in WSL without manually
moving them to Windows. I used this trick to develop Löve2D games from WSL
and launch them from Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

environment setup. I am using WSL 2 for this and as of writing this guide, this
is only available if you use windows insider preview to get
the nightly build of windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Setting it up on Windows&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://love2d.org&quot;&gt;love2d.org&lt;/a&gt; to download the necessary
installer. In my case I clicked on the &lt;em&gt;64-bit installer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I followed the installer so that the application was installed on the system. You
can test that this is working by typing &quot;love&quot; into the windows search bar and
clicking on the application. A stock GIF of a ballon 🎈 should pop up in the love
game window.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before transitioning over to WSL you need to add love to your environment
variables.
In the windows search bar type &lt;em&gt;edit the system environment variables&lt;/em&gt; and open
the dialog window that pops up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this does not work go the control panel and manually search for this window&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here click on environment variables and add the &lt;em&gt;.exe&lt;/em&gt; for Löve2D to your path.
For me this was located at &lt;strong&gt;C:/Program Files/LOVE&lt;/strong&gt; but this could vary depending
on what options you picked during installation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can test this by opening up command prompt and typing &lt;code class=&quot;abyss grvsc-mm-tJ07fR&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot; data-index=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-t9ljLd-1 grvsc-tJ07fR-1&quot;&gt;love&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; into the shell.
This should load the balloon GIF shown above. Once this is working you are ready
to transition to WSL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Setting it up on WSL&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open up WSL in your desired method&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Typing WSL into run.exe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Typing &lt;code class=&quot;abyss grvsc-mm-tJ07fR&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot; data-index=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-t9ljLd-1 grvsc-tJ07fR-1&quot;&gt;wsl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; in command prompt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using another terminal emulator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in WSL2, you can run windows &lt;em&gt;exe&apos;s&lt;/em&gt; by typing in the name of the entire exe.
However, it needs to be on your path for it to work. An example of this is to type
&lt;code class=&quot;abyss grvsc-mm-tJ07fR&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot; data-index=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-t9ljLd-1 grvsc-tJ07fR-1&quot;&gt;explorer.exe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to open up the windows file explorer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typing &lt;code class=&quot;abyss grvsc-mm-tJ07fR&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot; data-index=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-t9ljLd-1 grvsc-tJ07fR-1&quot;&gt;explorer.exe &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-t9ljLd-15 grvsc-tJ07fR-11&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; in WSL will open the windows file explorer in the WSL
file system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So from WSL, you can type &lt;code class=&quot;abyss grvsc-mm-tJ07fR&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot; data-index=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-t9ljLd-1 grvsc-tJ07fR-1&quot;&gt;love.exe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to run Löve2D from within WSL. To make the
development process similar to Linux/Unix you can make an alias to it. Personally,
I don&apos;t like typing out the &lt;em&gt;.exe&lt;/em&gt; every time so I have an alias for &lt;code class=&quot;abyss grvsc-mm-tJ07fR&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot; data-index=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-t9ljLd-1 grvsc-tJ07fR-1&quot;&gt;love&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. The below
script will add the alias to your bashrc and source it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;grvsc-container abyss grvsc-mm-tJ07fR&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot; data-index=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;grvsc-code&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-source&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-t9ljLd-1 grvsc-tJ07fR-1&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-t9ljLd-15 grvsc-tJ07fR-11&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-t9ljLd-1 grvsc-tJ07fR-1&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-t9ljLd-11 grvsc-tJ07fR-8&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;alias love=&amp;#39;love.exe&amp;#39;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-t9ljLd-1 grvsc-tJ07fR-1&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-t9ljLd-7 grvsc-tJ07fR-15&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-t9ljLd-1 grvsc-tJ07fR-1&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-t9ljLd-7 grvsc-tJ07fR-15&quot;&gt;~&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-t9ljLd-1 grvsc-tJ07fR-1&quot;&gt;/.bashrc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-source&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-t9ljLd-1 grvsc-tJ07fR-1&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-t9ljLd-15 grvsc-tJ07fR-11&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-t9ljLd-1 grvsc-tJ07fR-1&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-t9ljLd-7 grvsc-tJ07fR-15&quot;&gt;~&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-t9ljLd-1 grvsc-tJ07fR-1&quot;&gt;/.bashrc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are using a different shell or would prefer to put your aliases somewhere
else you can write it in manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you should be able to simply type &lt;code class=&quot;abyss grvsc-mm-tJ07fR&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot; data-index=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;grvsc-t9ljLd-1 grvsc-tJ07fR-1&quot;&gt;love&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; in your terminal to run Löve2D. You
are ready to develop and prototype your own games!! 🎮&lt;/p&gt;
