# Personal Site

This is the main development repo for my personal website/blog. It was developed
using GatsbyJS.

## TODO

- [ ] Add RSS feed functionality
- [ ] Make a project page in the same vein as your blog page
- [ ] Add a Web Hook to check grammar and spelling
- [ ] Do testing on different devices
- [ ] Image Optimization - they don't need to be that big
- [ ] Change background color to be a little easier on the eyes maybe a light red hue
- [ ] Fix blog post page
    - [ ] Tags should be colored (could make its own component)
    - [ ] Time to read
    - [ ] highlight.js integration
- [ ] Navbar just in the middle
- [ ] Change picture of yourself
- [ ] Add hover to the Blog Link Page
- [ ] See if the branch structure of the git repo can be changed so that master is gatsby, and gh-pages is the hosted site
