# Personal Site

This is the main development repo for my personal website/blog. It was developed
using GatsbyJS.

## TODO

- [ ] Make a project page in the same vein as your blog page
- [ ] Add a Web Hook to check grammar and spelling
- [ ] Do testing on different devices
- [ ] Image Optimization - they don't need to be that big
- [ ] Add time to read to each post
- [ ] Change picture of yourself
- [ ] See if the branch structure of the git repo can be changed so that master is gatsby, and gh-pages is the hosted site
- [ ] Filter by tags
