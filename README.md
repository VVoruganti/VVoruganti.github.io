# Personal Website Progress Tracker
Due to all of the issues with using hugo and managing versions it will probably be easier
to design your own version of content management

Can maybe use reactjs to manage creating new posts or can make a node script
that will generate the post files from markdown. 

## TODO

- [ ] Redesign Website using figma or something
- [ ] Think of blogs posts to make
- [ ] SEO optimization

## Design

### Portfolio

Could also give it a notion type aesthetic. Very minimalistic

### Blog

Should be designed based on notion.so like a notion page is a blog post
