Half of the time it was\nlike real life, but the other half it was as if I was in a cartoon.</p>\n<h2>Dream</h2>\n<p>The premise of the dream was that I was attending a fancy prep school and part of\na strange club where every member was actually a demon. But we were only demons in\nname. It was more like we were magical creatures from a Final Fantasy game. In\nreality, we were quite wholesome and acted like a home where loners could come and\nfind a purpose.</p>\n<h3>The School</h3>\n<p>Now, as our club was operating the principal was trying to verify\nif demons really did exist in his school. He kept trying to enlist my help in his\nsearch, so I had to constantly throw him off. As the days went by we started helping\nlots of different people with their problems by turning them into demons and giving\na new home and purpose. I don't remember the details of many of these, but we'll\nget to that later.</p>\n<h3>Karaoke</h3>\n<p>At this point, the style switches from a cartoon to real life again. I end up\ngoing to a karaoke bar with my high school friends. The waitress at the bar\nthinks we are too young and seats us in the kids' sections. Now none of us\nactually wanted to be at this bar, but we reluctantly stay and even end up\nsinging some songs together. Across from us is another group of friends who\nseem to be like our rivals. They try to put on a performance to outshine us,\nbut no one in our group seemed to really care. Eventually, two other kids who\nwere described as \"being from the wrong side of the tracks\" sit with us and\nstart hitting on the waitress. At some point, one of them throws me what looks\nlike a cosmic brownie, but is actually a pot brownie. I started questioning why\nso much effort was put into making it look like an actual cosmic brownie. Later\nin the night, the police show up to the karaoke bar and start going through the\nlocker room (I don't know why a bar has a locker room) looking for drugs.</p>\n<h3>Rescue Time</h3>\n<p>Now, we switch back to the cartoon style and go to a flashback of helping someone\nin the demon club. This person happened to be one of my very good friends in real\nlife. After helping her she becomes the designated summoner for the club. Then\nI flashback further to the events of actually helping her. I had gone to her\ntown with two ghost hunters who talked to the ghosts in the neighborhood to find\nher whereabouts. We eventually found her in what seemed to be a Wegmans parking lot.\nShe was having issues at home so we took her away to something akin to the underground\nrailroad. Except in this dream world, the underground railroad was made up of Chipotles.\nEvery Chipotle was really a front to hide refugees who needed a safe haven. So\nwe dropped her off where she was rated as their best guest to date. She ended\nup getting a +10 rating on the Chipotle guest list app which apparently existed.</p>\n<p>And that's where I woke up...</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"☁ Dream Journal #3 | Demons and Karaoke","date":"07/10/2020","tags":["Dreams"]},"excerpt":"This dream was unique because it was stylized differently.
