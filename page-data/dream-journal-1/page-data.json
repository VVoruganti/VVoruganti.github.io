I thought this would be a fun so here I go.</p>\n<h2>Rules of my Dreams</h2>\n<p>Before I get into my dream I want to explain some standard principles that\nmy dreams tend to follow.</p>\n<p>First, I am fairly in control of the plotline and scenario of a dream,\nbut I never realize this fact. My dream will quickly change depending on my\nthoughts to the point where the entire scenario is different. It's a similar\nfeeling to when you have a large thought loop where one moment you are thinking\nabout what you want to eat for dinner and 30 minutes later you are thinking about\nthe proper way to write a ternary statement in Lua.</p>\n<p>Second, I will rationalize the most absurd ideas possible for the sake of not\nrealizing that I am in a dream. An example of this could be that another\ncharacter besides me will be present in the dream, but will never say something.\nUsually, this probably just because I don't actually know what they would have\nsaid in whatever wacky scenario we're in. Nevertheless, I'll come up with a\ncrazy explanation like \"oh they were cursed by the evil queen in the castle\" even\nif there has never been any mention of a queen before now.</p>\n<p>Now that I got that out of the way, I wanted to describe my most recent vivid dream.</p>\n<h2>Dream</h2>\n<h3>The Party</h3>\n<p>So my dream started with me at a house party. It was not a house that I recognized\n, but I did recognize many of the people at this house. The attendees were all\nfamily friends which consisted of both my parents' and my brother's friends\nBoth of these groups of people seemed to be endlessly embroiled in mindless\nchit chat, however, I cannot remember what they talked about. Besides these two groups,\nthere was also me, my childhood friend, and a ton of small children 12 and younger.\nMy friend and I were tasked with taking care of the kids and keeping them occupied. So we spent\nour time trying to come up with creative ways to keep the kids entertained. We gave\nthem coloring books, played hide and seek, and at some point, I taught some of them\nhow to play League of Legends. At this point, I thought everything was going well,\nbut suddenly 3 of the kids came up to me and said they want to repent and then starting\nspeaking in Spanish. Now, this was really weird because I do not know Spanish.</p>\n<h3>High School Factory Life</h3>\n<p>Suddenly, I was transported back to high school (a true nightmare), except it wasn't\nreally highschool. Rather I was in something that resembled more of a steampunk\nfactory or a battleship. All of the students were engineers in this thing and were\nall performing different functions. I don't remember too much from this part except\nbeing in something like a dark basement looking for something.</p>\n<h3>Free Time</h3>\n<p>Then eventually we were on the Georgia Tech campus, but the people around me were\nstill my peers from high school. During this part, everyone was relaxing. Different\npeople split up into to their cliques and started chatting or doing some strange\nactivities like sailing in the grass. I wasn't sure what to do in this situation\nand ended up walking off into the sunset.</p>\n<h3>Hotel Room Shenanigans</h3>\n<p>Next, I was transported to an FBLA conference (A business club from high school)\nwhere I was hanging out in a hotel room. However, this quickly transitioned into\nme managing the conference and working with hotel staff to change the logistical\ndetails of the event.</p>\n<h3>Wedding Planner</h3>\n<p>The conference seemed to make a slow and gradual transition to a wedding. At first,\none half of the venue was a conference and the other half was a wedding.\nPretty soon it was only a wedding; one that I was managing with my cousin.\nLet's refer to her as cousin 1. Turns out the wedding was for another cousin who\nwe can call cousin 2. For some reason, she was 20 years old and getting an arranged\nmarriage. As far as the eye could see there were giant pastries and cakes lined\nup on circular tables in a giant ballroom. Cousin 2's father (my uncle) started\ngiving a loud speech about how proud he was of his daughter. While moving through\nthe different rooms of the venue I encountered cousin 2's sister (cousin 3) who was\njust hanging out with her friends and taking the whole affair nonchalantly. I spent\nsome time talking to her before finally waking up to my alarm.</p>\n<p>As you can imagine I was quite confused and dazed by the events of the night.</p>\n<style class=\"grvsc-styles\">\n  .grvsc-container {\n    overflow: auto;\n    position: relative;\n    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n    padding-top: 1rem;\n    padding-top: var(--grvsc-padding-top, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    padding-bottom: 1rem;\n    padding-bottom: var(--grvsc-padding-bottom, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    border-radius: 8px;\n    border-radius: var(--grvsc-border-radius, 8px);\n    font-feature-settings: normal;\n    line-height: 1.4;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-code {\n    display: table;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line {\n    display: table-row;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    width: 100%;\n    position: relative;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line > * {\n    position: relative;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter-pad {\n    display: table-cell;\n    padding-left: 0.75rem;\n    padding-left: calc(var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem)) / 2);\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter {\n    display: table-cell;\n    -webkit-user-select: none;\n    -moz-user-select: none;\n    user-select: none;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter::before {\n    content: attr(data-content);\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-source {\n    display: table-cell;\n    padding-left: 1.5rem;\n    padding-left: var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n    padding-right: 1.5rem;\n    padding-right: var(--grvsc-padding-right, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-source:empty::after {\n    content: ' ';\n    -webkit-user-select: none;\n    -moz-user-select: none;\n    user-select: none;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter + .grvsc-source {\n    padding-left: 0.75rem;\n    padding-left: calc(var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem)) / 2);\n  }\n  \n  /* Line transformer styles */\n  \n  .grvsc-has-line-highlighting > .grvsc-code > .grvsc-line::before {\n    content: ' ';\n    position: absolute;\n    width: 100%;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-diff-add::before {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-diff-add-background-color, rgba(0, 255, 60, 0.2));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-diff-del::before {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-diff-del-background-color, rgba(255, 0, 20, 0.2));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-number {\n    padding: 0 2px;\n    text-align: right;\n    opacity: 0.7;\n  }\n  \n</style>","frontmatter":{"title":"☁ Dream Journal #1 | Conferences and Weddings","date":"07/06/2020","tags":["Dreams"]},"excerpt":"Recently I've been having some pretty wild dreams and I was describing them to\na good friend of mine who suggested the idea that I start a…"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/dream-journal-1/"}}}
