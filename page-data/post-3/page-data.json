I thought this would be a fun idea so here I go.</p>\n<h2>Rules of my Dreams</h2>\n<p>Before I get into my dream itself I want to explain some standard principles that\nmy dreams tend to follow.</p>\n<p>First, I am fairly in control of the plot line and scenario of a dream,\nbut I never realize this fact. My dream will quickly change depending on my\nthoughts to the point where the entire scenario is different. It's a similar\nfeeling to when you have a large thought loop where one moment you are thinking\nabout what you want to eat for dinner and 30 minutes later you are thinking about\nthe proper way to write a ternary statement in Lua.</p>\n<p>Second, I will rationalize the most absurd ideas possible for the sake of not\nrealizing that I am in a dream. An example of this could be that another\ncharacter besides me will be present in the dream, but will never say something.\nUsually, this probably just because I don't actually know what they would have\nsaid in whatever wacky scenario we're in. Nevertheless, I'll come up with a\ncrazy explanation like \"oh they were cursed by the evil queen in the castle\" even\nwhen there has never been any mention of a queen before now.</p>\n<p>Now that I got that out of the way I wanted to describe my most recent vivid dream.</p>\n<h2>Dream</h2>\n<p>Like first I was in this house and there was like a party going on for what felt\nlike days. But like a house party with life my parents and all their friends and\ntheir friends kids. Like this friend group we've had since we were kids. An all\nthe adults were just like going around and talking and like walking around the\nhouse. And then there are like 10 people my brother's age and they were just being\ndegenerates around the house. Then there was me and this one other dude my age and\nlike 20 kids 12 and under. So like me and this other dude had to take care of the\nkids and we kept trying to find ways to like keep them entertained like giving\nthem coloring books, video game, at some point I taught some kids how to play league.</p>\n<p>and then some kids came up to me and started saying how they want to repent to\ngod and then started speaking in Spanish.</p>\n<p>Then suddenly I was like in high school except the high school was like this giant\nindustrial factory battleship thing and all the students were like engineerings trying\nto take care of the ship. Then eventually we were like on the GT campus, but I\nwas still only with people from high school.</p>\n<p>So we were like on break or something and everyone started separating into their\ngroups, but no one wanted to talk to me or hang out so I like walked into the sunset</p>\n<p>So then I was like at an FBLA conference and hanging out in the hotel rooms with\npeople, but then suddenly I had to l was like managing the conference with my\ncousin, but also on the other side of the hotel my other cousin was getting an\narranged marriage</p>\n<p>and there were like giant sweets as far as the eye could see, but also my cousin\nwas like 20 and getting an arranged marriage</p>\n<p>which is super off brand, and my uncle was giving like all of these huge speeches.\nSo then I was like trying to manage logistics while my cousin's sister was just like\nrelaxing with her friends, but as far away from the bride as possible</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"☁ Dream Journal #1","date":"07/06/2020","tags":["Dreams"]},"excerpt":"Recently I've been having some pretty wild dreams and I was describing them to\na good friend of mine who thought it would be a good idea if…"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/post-3/"}}}
