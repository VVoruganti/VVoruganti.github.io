I didn't expect to have another\none so fast but here we are.</p>\n<h2>Dream</h2>\n<h3>The Pool</h3>\n<p>So the dream started out with me at a pool in a strange community center.\nI don't remember what exactly I was doing at the pool besides swimming around.\nIt felt like I was here hours and hours, but eventually, I had to get out of the\npool so that it could be cleaned. Soon after I was forced to leave because I\nwas not with any group.</p>\n<h3>The Explosion</h3>\n<p>After leaving the pool I decided to go back the high school, which is about a\n25-minute drive from my childhood home. However, in the dream, I ended up\nwalking to the school, and I came from the completely opposite direction.\nFrom what I could tell, I was traveling back in time in order to stop some sort\nof tragedy from occurring. I stopped at a particularly busy intersection where\nthe traffic is always really bad due to the roads being too small. One of the\nbuildings I was standing next to ended up exploding, which really alarmed me.\nI decided to call the police, but the building was the police station. A police\nofficer came up to me in a car and said that he \"would investigate\" then suddenly\nturned around and drove away on the wrong side of the road. This entire time the\ntraffic jam on the intersection continued like normal.</p>\n<h3>The Crime</h3>\n<p>The building that exploded then revealed that it had a secondary purpose of being\na daycare for small children. My dream transitioned to the point of view of a child\nin the daycare. I was in a different house and dealing with the trauma of the explosion.\nI was freaking out, but then, as quickly as I became this child, I quickly became\nmyself again. I was at school finally, except the school looked like my childhood\nhome. My class was also my room. One of the other students around me had stolen\nsomething and chaos started to ensue in order to find the culprit. Then on our\nphones President Barack Obama sent a message telling the students to be calm. It\nwas then tasked to me to find the thief. I discovered him in what looked like my\nparents' bedroom and retrieved whatever was stolen. I'm not entirely sure what the\nitem was. It might have been a wallet, but I can't be too certain.</p>\n<h3>The Class</h3>\n<p>After the chaos was down, I started conducting a science experiment with one of my\nprofessors from Georgia Tech. We were constructing a telescope while he was complaining\nabout why the International Baccalaureate system is flawed. This was very strange\nboth because I would not expect him to know about the IB and he was an ECE professor.\nWe finished the telescope but when we tried to open the window to use it, a large\ngust of wind blew everything away.</p>\n<p>There is a gap in my memory here, but the last event I remember is sitting around\na table (which may have also been my bed) with one guy and girl. I had recognized\nthe guy from high school, but I had never seen this girl before. The girl started\ntalking about how she was incredibly high from taking 20 doses of LSD, while the\nother guy and I started to get concerned. The vice-principal of my high school\nshowed up and started to do a blood test of the girl without her noticing. The\nprincipal then said not to get involved with the girl before I finally woke up.</p>\n<style class=\"grvsc-styles\">\n  .grvsc-container {\n    overflow: auto;\n    position: relative;\n    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n    padding-top: 1rem;\n    padding-top: var(--grvsc-padding-top, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    padding-bottom: 1rem;\n    padding-bottom: var(--grvsc-padding-bottom, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    border-radius: 8px;\n    border-radius: var(--grvsc-border-radius, 8px);\n    font-feature-settings: normal;\n    line-height: 1.4;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-code {\n    display: table;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line {\n    display: table-row;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    width: 100%;\n    position: relative;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line > * {\n    position: relative;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter-pad {\n    display: table-cell;\n    padding-left: 0.75rem;\n    padding-left: calc(var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem)) / 2);\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter {\n    display: table-cell;\n    -webkit-user-select: none;\n    -moz-user-select: none;\n    user-select: none;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter::before {\n    content: attr(data-content);\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-source {\n    display: table-cell;\n    padding-left: 1.5rem;\n    padding-left: var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n    padding-right: 1.5rem;\n    padding-right: var(--grvsc-padding-right, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-source:empty::after {\n    content: ' ';\n    -webkit-user-select: none;\n    -moz-user-select: none;\n    user-select: none;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter + .grvsc-source {\n    padding-left: 0.75rem;\n    padding-left: calc(var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem)) / 2);\n  }\n  \n  /* Line transformer styles */\n  \n  .grvsc-has-line-highlighting > .grvsc-code > .grvsc-line::before {\n    content: ' ';\n    position: absolute;\n    width: 100%;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-diff-add::before {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-diff-add-background-color, rgba(0, 255, 60, 0.2));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-diff-del::before {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-diff-del-background-color, rgba(255, 0, 20, 0.2));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-number {\n    padding: 0 2px;\n    text-align: right;\n    opacity: 0.7;\n  }\n  \n</style>","frontmatter":{"title":"☁ Dream Journal #2 | Going back to school","date":"07/09/2020","tags":["Dreams"]},"excerpt":"I decided that I didn't want to put every single dream I ever had on here,\nso I'm just going to focus on the interesting ones.
