[{"categories":null,"contents":"This patent was developed in order to address the problem of trying to synchronize two simultaneous data streams that relied on different clocks. The contraints under which this methodology were developed involved the process to be completeley offline to not involve establishing a new connection between the data collection devices.\nThe final solution had several aspects to it:\n A testing system to determine the level to which the two devices are out of sync A calculation methodology for using the information from the test to quantify the difference A consideration for variable rates and drift in both of the devices.

In many schools or office buildings the evacuation plans always generally follow the same structure in each drill. This tool allows for dynamic management of emergencies in the event of a crisis. The plan can adapt to the location of danger within the building and the location of each individual participant.\n","permalink":"/projects/creations/smartevac/","tags":["JavaScript","NodeJS"],"title":"SmartEvac"}]
