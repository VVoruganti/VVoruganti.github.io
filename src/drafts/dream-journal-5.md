There were a lot of different ones on this night. In the first one
everyone around was racist and hated me for being brown. I was trying
to get into a party run by a high school acquaintance and his fraternity, but
he wouldn't let me in. (vaguely related to me being brown) So, I snuck in instead.
But soon after his paretns were coming so I had to find the batcave in their house
and use the batcycle to escape onto a bridge. The setting for this dream was that
of a black void (similar to the hyperbolic time chamber from dragon ball z but black)
with nothing except this house.

Next, I was doing an FBLA scholarship challenge where I had to fly in a ballon
and skydive down through these rings? The person with the most accuracy and hearts
(like in zelda) won. I lost on my first attempt. My brother showed up with me and
started telling me about how when he was my age, he was able to easily win, but
that I probably wouldn't be able to do it no matter how hard I tried. So I
showed up, for my second attempt, against the teams from Great Valley and Oxford
Highschool (neighboring school districts), which had full teams of people opposed
to me by myself. One team only had 1/2 heart and the other had 3 so I was somewhat
confident, but I woke up on my way up on the ballon.

Next, I was in my 9th grade english teacher's chemistry class (yes I don't
understand either) trying to get Magnesium Oxide. He got mad, told me to
"take care of it", and left. So I had to sneak to the teacher in the classroom do
some calculations to figure out how much I needed. But the supply teacher
just ended up giving me a vial and said to go nuts.

The next dream was just like visuals of a monopoly board and train following this
weird pattern, but the narration was of my mom and a friend's mom. I could only
hear my mother's dialogue, but I could make out their conversations. Mainly they
talked about me being a disappointment. At the same time I was in my brother's room
and my father was surrounded by what seemed like hundreds of bars of Olay brand
soap.

Finally, I don't remember much except feeling like I was at an FBLA conference
trying to start an amusement park. But I also was aware that I was asleep and
of my physical body in the real world. I tried really hard to get up but was
just stuck in a dark void feeling like my body weighed a million pounds. I also
felt nauseous when trying to wake up.
