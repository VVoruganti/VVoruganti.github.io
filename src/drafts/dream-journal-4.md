So this night consisted of several unrelated dreams opposed to one large plot.
I remember there being 4 sepearate dreams, but I can only remember the events of
3.

So the first dream I remember was where I was an officer in the Swedish Navy and
had to defend the country against a viking invasion. I managed to repurpose some
ships to create a new vessel that had never been seen before. I don't really
remember what made it so special, but I remember it was a game changer in the war
effort. This all took place on a set of docks. After I made this new ship, I spent
my time teaching a troop of boyscouts about different knots and explaining how with
practice the different knots would become muscle memory to tie.

There's a gap in my memory here. I remember vividly that there was a 2nd dream,
but I cannot for the life of me remember what exactly it was.

In the next dream, I was at my childhood home, but it felt like my house was a
massive warehouse. The crux of the dream was that there was a worm that was roaming
the house and a parasite that caused the worm to gain black stripes and bend into
the shape of a "W." The ends were legs and it would jump around like a frog. The
stripes had a texture of a hair scrunchy. In the dream was I absolutely terrified
of the parasite, but whenever I tried to go to someone and warn them about it, they
wouldn't care. I specifically remember my mother ignoring me when I told her about
the parasite.

Finally, I was visiting a world war 2 memorial with someone in Germany. It was a
massive structure with several temples, an inside, and outside portion. There was
a lower temple that went into a cave and, outside, there was a giant statue that
looked like an angel alter from Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild. The ones where
you give your dungeon tokens to get a heart or stamina container. There was some
ceremony happening outside that the crowd referred to as "Lestroika." In the dream
I kept misunderstanding though and heard the word "Perestroika" instead, which may
or may not be one of the policies instituted by Gorbachev that led to the fall of
the USSR. I kept arguing with someone in the crowd abou it.
