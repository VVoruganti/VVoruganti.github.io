I had a couple shorter dreams so I combined two nights into one post.

## 7/14/2020

The first part I remember is working a job and living close to the office in
some kind of hostel type place. I was telling a childhood friend about the
job and my living situation.

Then I was trapped in some sort of ice world where I was slowly dying and struggling
to stay alive. There were others around me, but I remember feeling very alone. This
world was also in my childhood bedroom and it was an immense struggle to get to
my computer from my bed. (about a 5ft walk) Once I got to my computer, I frantically
tried to do some linux thing? Maybe add myself as a sudoer? But whatever it was,
the purpose was to prevent me from dying. While I was freaking out some of my high
school friends visited me and acted like everything was normal while I was dying.

Then I was in a school where my mother was a teacher and teaching a class on how
to be a ninja. I wasn't enrolled in the class, so I had to go to the basement and
attempt to do archery. I was INCREDIBLY bad at it. The school was in my
chilldhood home, the ninja class was in my room, and as I said before, the archery
class was in the basement.

Immediately after waking up, I could not remember a lot about this dream. I
remember it all followed on big plot line. I was some kind of ranger, but not
a forest ranger or power ranger. Instead I was something like a pokemon ranger and
I was going on various missions. I don't remember too much
about the missions, but I remember the final part being on this space station
where I turned into a girl or something and was struggling to save the planet from
an evil scientist. I slept for about 6 hours and woke up feeling rested, but my eyes
felt tired. I also took me quite a  bit of time to realize my alarm was not a part
of my dream.
