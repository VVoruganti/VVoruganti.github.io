Recently I've been having some pretty wild dreams and I was describing them to
a good friend of mine who thought it would be a good idea if I tried starting a
dream journal. I thought this would be a fun idea so here I go.

## Rules of my Dreams

Before I get into my dream itself I want to explain some standard principles that
my dreams tend to follow.

First, I am fairly in control of the plot line and scenario of a dream,
but I never realize this fact. My dream will quickly change depending on my
thoughts to the point where the entire scenario is different. It's a similar
feeling to when you have a large thought loop where one moment you are thinking
about what you want to eat for dinner and 30 minutes later you are thinking about
the proper way to write a ternary statement in Lua.

Second, I will rationalize the most absurd ideas possible for the sake of not
realizing that I am in a dream. An example of this could be that another
character besides me will be present in the dream, but will never say something.
Usually, this probably just because I don't actually know what they would have
said in whatever wacky scenario we're in. Nevertheless, I'll come up with a
crazy explanation like "oh they were cursed by the evil queen in the castle" even
when there has never been any mention of a queen before now.

Now that I got that out of the way I wanted to describe my most recent vivid dream.

## Dream

Like first I was in this house and there was like a party going on for what felt
like days. But like a house party with life my parents and all their friends and
their friends kids. Like this friend group we've had since we were kids. An all
the adults were just like going around and talking and like walking around the
house. And then there are like 10 people my brother's age and they were just being
degenerates around the house. Then there was me and this one other dude my age and
like 20 kids 12 and under. So like me and this other dude had to take care of the
kids and we kept trying to find ways to like keep them entertained like giving
them coloring books, video game, at some point I taught some kids how to play league.

and then some kids came up to me and started saying how they want to repent to
god and then started speaking in Spanish.

Then suddenly I was like in high school except the high school was like this giant
industrial factory battleship thing and all the students were like engineerings trying
to take care of the ship. Then eventually we were like on the GT campus, but I
was still only with people from high school.

So we were like on break or something and everyone started separating into their
groups, but no one wanted to talk to me or hang out so I like walked into the sunset

So then I was like at an FBLA conference and hanging out in the hotel rooms with
people, but then suddenly I had to l was like managing the conference with my
cousin, but also on the other side of the hotel my other cousin was getting an
arranged marriage

and there were like giant sweets as far as the eye could see, but also my cousin
was like 20 and getting an arranged marriage

which is super off brand, and my uncle was giving like all of these huge speeches.
So then I was like trying to manage logistics while my cousin's sister was just like
relaxing with her friends, but as far away from the bride as possible
